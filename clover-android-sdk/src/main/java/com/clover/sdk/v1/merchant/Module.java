/**
 * Modules control which software features a merchant has access to and which apps a merchant may
 * install and use. The modules enabled for a particular merchant are defined by the plan that a
 * merchant is currently enrolled in. See
 * <a href="https://docs.clover.com/clover-platform/docs/understanding-modules">Clover Docs:
 * Understanding Modules</a> for detailed information about plans and modules.
 * <p/>
 * App developers can choose which modules they consider required for their app on the developer app
 * dashboard. Merchants will not be able to purchase or install an app unless their plan has all the
 * required modules for that particular app.
 * <p/>
 * An app developer may choose to not require a module but could instead detect the enabled modules
 * at runtime to show or hide software features.
 * <p/>
 * Modules <b>do not</b> affect API functionality. For example, assuming an app has proper
 * permissions, an app may still use the inventory APIs for a merchant that does not have the
 * "ITEMS" module enabled.
