/**
 * Lock and unlock a Clover device's lock screen. On Clover devices
 * lock and unlocking the screen is tied to logging out and logging in Clover employees.
 * <p/>
 * Please consider use of these methods carefully.
 * Clover devices' passcode login system provides security and auditing to
 * merchants. Misuse of this class can circumvent these systems. If you plan to use this class
 * for a production Clover application please post in
 * <a href="https://community.clover.com">community.clover.com</a>
 * to ensure your use case will pass Clover's approval process.
 * <p/>
 * Developers should prefer to unlock to the default employee if enabled by the merchant. This
 * can be handled transparently with the {@link #unlock()} method that will prefer the default
 * employee if enabled, and otherwise will unlock to the owner employee.
 * <p/>
 * To explicitly unlock to the default employee use {@link #unlockDefault()}. Note that this will
 * fail if the default employee is not enabled by the merchant.
 * <p/>
 * To check if the merchant has a default employee use the following code:
 * <pre>
 *   EmployeeConnector ec; // Obtain an instance in the usual way
 *   Employee defaultEmployee = ec.getEmployee(Lockscreen.DEFAULT_EMPLOYEE_ID);
 *   boolean isDefaultEmployeeEnabled = defaultEmployee != null;
 * </pre>
 * To unlock to a specific employee use {@link #unlock(String)}. To get a list of employees
 * and their UUIDs use {@link com.clover.sdk.v3.employees.EmployeeConnector#getEmployees()}.
 * <p/>
 * All lock / unlock methods return a boolean indicating if the operation was successful.
 * Attempting to unlock a device that is already unlocked will fail.
 * Attempting to lock a device that is already locked will fail.
 * <p/>
 * To understand if a Clover device is currently locked use
 * {@link @link com.clover.sdk.v3.employees.EmployeeConnector#getEmployee()}.
 * This will return either the currently logged in employee, or null
 * otherwise.
 * <p/>
 * To understand if the merchant has enabled the default employee, use
 * {@link com.clover.sdk.v3.employees.EmployeeConnector#getEmployee(String)} with and argument
 * of {@link #DEFAULT_EMPLOYEE_ID}.
 * <p/>
 * The behavior of these methods on non-Clover devices and Android emulators differs. On
 * non-Clover devices, Clover software does not control the lock screen. While the methods in this
 * class will logout or login Clover employees, they will not cause the device's lock screen
 * to show or hide.
